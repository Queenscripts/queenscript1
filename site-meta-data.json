    "description": "I am a full stack engineer with a passion for front-end web technologies, frameworks, and libraries including vanilla Javascript, jQuery, React and Vue.js. When I dabble on the back end, you can find me working with Python, Ruby, Node and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I'd love to work with awesome programmers who are also versed in these technologies so that we can sharpen our skills as a team. When I'm not coding, I'm doing something creative with words from my lettering projects to my performative poetry.:)"
